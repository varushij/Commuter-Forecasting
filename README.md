# Commuter-Forecasting
Time Series Forecasting to predict JetRail commuters (Python)

An investment firm, called Unicorn Ventures is interested to invest in JetRail - a new form of transportation. But since the transportation is quite new, they ar not sure about the future of this investment. It would be a good investment only if it achieves a target of 1 Million monthly users in next 18 months. <br />
In order to help the decision makers in Unicorn Ventures make decision, we try to forecast the traffic on JetRail in the coming 7 months with the help of data captured in the past from 25th August 2012 to 25th September 2014.<br />
